# Shopping Cart
This project is a basic web store application that implements a shopping cart and order history for users. It is built with Flask and uses a SQLite3 database.

## Running the web app
1. Setup the database by runnging `sqlite3 database.db ".read store_schema.sql"` in the terminal. (This can also be used to reset the database.)
2. Run `python3 main.py` in the terminal.
3. Open the link in the terminal to view the web app.
